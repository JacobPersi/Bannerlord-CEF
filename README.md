# Chromium Embedded Framework Off-Screen Rendering in M&B II: Bannerlord
Web rendering in Bannerlord. This is an early implementation and more work is required (currently a memory leak). 

I prototyped this to assess feasible for developing a web-based UI framework for Bannerlord modding. I plan to work on this separately, but figure this code could may be useful for some.
